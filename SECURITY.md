## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please create an issue explaining exactly what the vulnerability is, where it is, and a possible fix. I will look over these often and maybe quickly if I get a notification.

If the vulnerability is in a dependency, how long it will take is depending on how much changed in the new version.
