## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

To report a vulnerability, please create an issue using the template "Security Issue". I will look over these often and maybe quickly if I get a notification.

If the vulnerability is in a dependency, how long it will take is depending on how much changed in the new version.
